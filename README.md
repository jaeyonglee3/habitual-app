## Demo Video
This [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWWjwJ__vo) shows the app in action. For a deeper explanation, see below.

## Intro and Tech Stack
Habitual is an **iOS** application written in **Swift** that helps you track and maintain your daily habits with customizable goals and progress visualization.

## Functionality
Habitual allows users to create and track daily habits, set repetition goals, and monitor their progress throughout the week. It provides visual cues, such as checkboxes and progress bars, to represent the completion status of each habit. The target audience is broad, encompassing anyone striving to improve their daily routines and form positive habits. This could include individuals focusing on health and fitness goals, productivity, or personal development and mindfulness practices. 

It solves the problem of inconsistency and lack of motivation by providing a clear, organized way to monitor and maintain habit formation. By tracking progress, Habitual taps into the psychology of reinforcement, motivating users to continue their positive behaviors. Research has shown that visual cues and progress tracking can significantly improve habit formation.

## Value and Usefulness
Habitual provides value by offering a structured and visual way to track daily goals. This is beneficial because it helps users stay organized and motivated, which can be challenging when trying to establish new habits. The app's clear presentation of progress and daily goals serves as a constant reminder and encourages users to stay on track.

This can solve the real-world problem of inconsistency in maintaining new habits. Many people start with good intentions but lose momentum due to a lack of organization or a way to monitor their efforts. Habitual addresses this by providing a dedicated space to log and visualize progress, making the process of forming new habits more manageable.

## Setup Guide
